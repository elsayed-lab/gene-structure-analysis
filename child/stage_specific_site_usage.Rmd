## Differences in trans-splicing acceptor site usage across developmental stage

For each pair of parasite developmental stages, a scatterplot showing the 
locations of primary SL sites which differ across stage is shown.

Further, genes which meet the following requirements and are thus are likely
candidates for SL switching are listed below:

1. Primary to secondary site coverage ratio > 2 for all stages
2. Minimum of 10 reads for all stages
3. Primary site location differs between at least two stages, and is located
   at least 20nt apart.
